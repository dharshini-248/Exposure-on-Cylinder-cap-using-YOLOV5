<h3 align="center">Cylinder Cap Prediction</h3>


## Problem Statement
In LPG Cylinder manufacturing companies lot of cylinders are manufactured , there are scenario like that they may not noticed whether cylinder closed and leakage  of gas happens. To detect and tell the gas cylinders are opened or close with an alarm system.

## About The Project
Implementing a alarm system to detect weather the cap is opened or closed. If the cap is opened there will be a leakage of gas, which is a hazardous situation.This happens in the mass production of cylinders. By using our alarm system this can be prevented.

## Project Overview

Over 70% of Indian people use Liquified Petroleum Gas(LPG) cylinders as their frequent cooking fuel . 
Firmly 85%  of users have LPG connection and the south Asian country became the second largest consumer of LPG over the globe.
While pre fabricating ,some cylinder caps may open which are not perceived by workers.
This results in the leakage of LPG.
To address this problem we are introducing a new automated OPEN/CLOSE cap detection alarm system for cylinders.
In this project deep learning really shines when it comes to complex problems such as image classification. 
To classify open/close cap exposure , we used YOLO object detection with an open cv package.
Here we trained more than 1000 images to get the  absolute results.
The main goal of this project is to recalibrate the problems faced by LPG manufacturing .
